# GROCERIES-JAVA

A small app to fiddle with Java and Eclipse, which is a challenge in itself...

Several class, calling each others and having inner properties that can be `get` but not `set`

## TODO

 - [X] Creating basic classes that interact that calls each others.
 - [ ] set up a small server with a SOAP/REST API.
 - [ ] call externals APIs.
 - [ ] set up workers, automate some small operations.
